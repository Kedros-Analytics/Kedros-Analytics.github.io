<h2>What are Self-Service Analytics &amp; BI:</h2>
<p>Self-service Analytics, is a user-driven approach to data analysis that empowers non-technical users to access, explore, and visualize data without relying on data specialists.  Self-service capabilities typically feature drag-and-drop functionality, pre-built calculations, and AI capabilities, making it easy for business professionals to analyze data in real-time.</p><!--
This approach accelerates decision-making, reduces bottlenecks, and fosters a data-driven culture within organizations, as stakeholders can directly interact with data to answer their own questions and uncover trends.</p>

<h2>Key Benefits of Self-Service BI:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Faster Decision-Making</strong> - Employees can access and analyze data in real-time without waiting for IT or data teams to generate reports, enabling quicker responses to market changes and operational challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowered Employees</strong> - Non-technical users can independently explore data, create reports, and build dashboards using intuitive tools, reducing dependency on IT or data analysts.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Agility</strong> - Businesses can adapt quickly to changing conditions by allowing users to analyze data on the fly and uncover insights without delays.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong> - Reduces the need for extensive IT involvement in report generation, lowering operational costs and minimizing errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Data-Driven Culture</strong> - Encourages employees at all levels to use data in their daily decision-making, promoting curiosity, innovation, and accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability</strong> - Self-service BI tools can scale with the organization, accommodating growing data needs and more users without significant additional resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Collaboration</strong> - Teams can share insights, reports, and dashboards easily, fostering collaboration across departments and ensuring everyone works with the same up-to-date information.</li>
        <li><strong>Customized Insights</strong> - Users can tailor reports and dashboards to their specific needs, ensuring they get the most relevant and actionable insights for their roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Productivity</strong> - Automates repetitive tasks like data preparation and report generation, allowing employees to focus on strategic activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong> - Enables businesses to uncover hidden trends, identify opportunities, and address challenges faster than competitors relying on traditional BI methods.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Relevant Infrastructure:</h3>
<p>To increase further the potential for self-service analytics and enable a productive collaboration between the various types of analytics professionals, a platform like Microsoft Fabric or Azure Databricks might be of benefit. Fabric in particular, can provide a positive ROI, even for SME's, due to its <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/microsoft-fabric/">low entry cost</a>. It also includes <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction">GenAI capabilities</a>, to enable AI-powered self-service analytics. It also empowers your team to gain near-real time insights and to perform even more advanced analytics, due to its built-in Data Science and Machine Learning capabilities.

<h2>What are Advanced Analytics:</h2>
<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analytics">Advanced analytics</b></a> refer to the application of sophisticated analytical techniques derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">Statistics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">Econometrics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research">Operational Research</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>, to extract deeper insights from data and support complex business decisions. Unlike traditional Business Intelligence, which focuses on descriptive and potentially diagnostic insights, advanced analytics leverage predictive and prescriptive models to help identify key drivers &amp; understand their impact, control &amp; improve processes, and recommend (or automatically implement) near-optimal actions.</p>

<p>A simple yet practical example of advanced analytics in action is the calculation of safety stocks, reorder points, and minimum order quantities for inventory management. In the below example, we can see those metrics calculated on input such as SKU daily orders, and parameters related to the ABC classification of items, lead time, etc. (you may click to download the Python enabled Excel file):</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/mattprotopapas/modern-examples/raw/main/PyExcel/InventoryControlAnalyticsExample.xlsx">
		<img src="images/InventoryControlLogisticsExampleScreenshot.jpg" alt="Inventory Control Reults" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 2px solid #000; padding: 4px; border-radius: 6px;">
	</a>
</p>


<p>Calculating those metrics provides significant value, but is only the first step. To further generate value we can:
<ul><li>Adapt the approach to your inventory control framework.</li>
<li>Help you establish end-to-end processes to enable monitoring of both the stock levels and the effectiveness of inventory management in general.</li>
<li>Setup proactive alerts when stock nears reorder points, introduce automations &amp; AI agents, to transform insights into actions that generate value.</li>
<li>Design and implement further analytics &amp; KPIs for tactical decision-making, to drive longer term, sustainable growth.</li>
</ul>
The result? <b>&rarr; Reduced supply chain risk, improved service levels, and more efficient use of working capital.</b></p>

<p>In addition to equipping decision makers and analytics teams with the tools they need to understand what happened, why it happened, and what actions to take, we also help establish a strong foundation for collaborative analytics and improved productivity through Power BI enhancements in areas like Financial Planning &amp; Analysis.</p>
