Developed Power BI reports, contributed to the development of Azure Synapse pipelines and supported (pre)sales activities. Helped clients in the financial services, education &amp; shipping industries.<!-- Projects included:

<ul>
<li>Power Apps & Power BI for a leading insurance company: The client wanted to streamline their governance and quality control processes. Office Line developed a
set of Power Apps, integrated with SharePoint to help them manage their access rights, issues handling
and role management processes. I implemented a set of Power BI reports to facilitate monitoring and
control. The client is expected to improve their productivity and mitigate process risk, while having
saved on development costs significantly at the same time.</li>

<li>Power BI reports for a global shipping company: The client required a set of automatic reports to inform their customers in a personalized way. We
created a set of Power BI reports informing on shipments, orders and costs. The reports have advanced
UI features and ensure each customer accesses the data relevant to them. The client is expected to
serve their customers information needs in an even more interactive way, while saving on operational
costs.</li>

<li>Power BI reports for a global examinations organization: The client needed to migrate an extensive set of reports, inherited by a company they recently acquired.
We worked with the client to redesign the reports as necessary, map the data requirements to their
Enterprise Data Warehouse, and develop the reports in Power BI. The client is expected to increase
their tactical and operational management capabilities even further, through the insights provided by the
new reporting pack.</li>
