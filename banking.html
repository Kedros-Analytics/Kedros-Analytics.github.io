							<p><b> Remediation projects for leading UK banks</b><br>
							As an EY UK employee, I participated in three remediation projects for leading UK banks, spanning a total budget of over GBP 50 mio and 1000+ internal and external stakeholders. The projects were so extensive, that dedicated CPM software had been developed to run and manage them. I was a member of the MI teams, who were responsible for reporting on the projects' progress. I created data marts and data flows to populate them from the CPM system databases, developed automatic reporting capability, and coached team members on creating, reviewing and distributing reports. The reporting capabilities we developed were used by all project stakeholders. Steering committees, senior management, quality assurance teams and project teams who used them to monitor their day-to-day work; as well as regulatory authorities.</p>
							
<p><b>Reporting pack on loan approvals for a leading Greek bank</b><br>
Facilitated application process monitoring for a leading Greek bank, developing a Power BI reporting pack and a relevant data mart, together with a global consulting firm and client stakeholders.</p>
							
<p><b>Cash Logistics BPM for a leading Greek bank</b><br>
Participated in a Cash management BPM project for a major Greek bank: scope definition, functional specifications, process design and automation on a relevant BPM platform, in order to facilitate for improved cash  ordering processes on the bank’s branches.</p>

<p><b>RAROC Calculation Tool for a Greek bank</b><br>
Involved in a Risk-adjusted Performance Measurement project for a major Greek bank: contributed to the development of a data mart &amp; ETL tool and used it to perform RAROC calculations on corporate loan portfolios.</p>

<p><b>Social Media Analytics PoC for a leading UK bank</b><br>
The PoC demonstrated the effectiveness of sentiment analysis &amp; topic modeling, using data from the bank's Twitter channels. I created the relevant scripts, apps and dashboards. We demonstrated the value of detecting novel complaint categories and identifying trends &amp; key topics.
</p>
							
							<p><b>A-IRB Models Validation for a leading UK bank</b><br>
Supported the Wholesale Model Validation workstream of a Major UK Bank for various PD/LGD/EAD models on the corporate, large corporate, acquisition finance and IPRE portfolios, focusing on models’ accuracy, stability, discriminatory power, conservatism, calibration, downturn adjustment and rank ordering exercises.</p>
							
							<p><b>AMA Operational Risk for leading Greek bank</b><br>
Engaged in the capital calculation of operational risk of a major Greek bank, in the context of Basel II Pillar 2(ICAAP), following AMA methodologies. Contributed to the development of relevant software tools.</p>

<p><b>Credit Risk Modeling for a Greek bank</b><br>
Participated in an IRB Credit Risk Modeling project for a major Greek bank. Customer segmentation, data transformation, and modeling scripts.</p>

<p><b>Scorecard Redevelopment for a leading Greek bank</b><br>
Engaged in the re-development of a Slotting Model for a major Greek bank.  Performed a factor/score distribution analysis of the existing scorecard, while developed an algorithm that optimized model performance by adjusting model weights and scores.</p>
		<p><b>Risk Modeling Toolset</b><br>
This was an internal project within the EY advisory team. The team wanted to have a library of scripts to engage productively within A-IRB credit risk projects. I wrote a set of modeling & validation scripts, as well as scripts for automatic reports generation. The scripts have been put in good use during several credit risk modeling projects, enhancing the productivity of the engagement teams substantively.</p>
