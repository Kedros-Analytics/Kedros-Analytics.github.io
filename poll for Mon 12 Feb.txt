Do you include a message in connection requests? Do you think it's helpful?

We were discussing with my friend @Angelos the other day about the importance of including messages in connection requests.

On first thought it seemed obvious they would provide a personal touch and increase the change of the invitation being accepted.

Being an analytics guy, I did some testing.

Sent out 20 invitation requests with a message included. Result: only 2/20 accepted ?!

In parallel, I sent another 20 requests with NO message attached. Result: 11/20 accepted!

Why would that be? 

Is it because I have 20+ years in the market and a message about me trying to extend my network would make me look 'junior'?
Is it because the analytics market here in Athens is not that extensive, so a message would only create 'clutter'?
Is it the case that a young person trying to extend their network would see the exact opposite result?

I don't know at this point.
 
Do you include messages in your connection requests? 
Are they beneficial?
