<h2>Maturity of data-driven decision making</h2>
<p>There are 4 levels of analytics maturity a company can achieve - with each level enabling more data-driven decisions and more business value.</p>

  <p>
    Traditionally, a scaled analytics landscape was something only large corporations could afford.
    They built extensive data warehouses—massive projects involving large teams of people working
    for months or even years—to establish that <em>“single version of truth”</em> which enabled them
    to produce consistent and accurate reports automatically.
  </p>

  <p>
    Level 4 was elusive even for most Global 500 corporations, due to the continuous evolution of
    the market landscape. Large organizations have always found it challenging to adapt quickly to such changes.
  </p>
  
<br><br>

<br><br>



  <p>
    Nowadays, with the technology available, it is entirely possible for an SME to achieve scaled analytical
    capabilities. Furthermore, optimization now has more to do with adopting modern analytical tools (e.g., AI) and being agile
    enough to move proactively as the market evolves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Partnering with an expert &amp; efficient team and leveraging the appropriate toolsets can substantially increase ROI as
    an SME evolves its capabilities across these stages. Indicative toolsets for each stage include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Initial Stage – Spreadsheets (e.g., Excel):</strong><br>
      The <em>“Swiss knife”</em> of analytics has become increasingly powerful in recent years, with embedded AI
      and programming capabilities now available.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Emerging Stage – Self-Service BI Tools (e.g., Power BI):</strong><br>
      As the company grows into the <em>small-to-medium</em> stage, more people require accurate and consistent
      information compiled under a common set of assumptions and rules. Reports can be refreshed automatically,
      further reducing costs.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Scaled Stage – Scalable Platforms (e.g., Microsoft Fabric):</strong><br>
      The need to analyze large and diverse datasets, combined with the requirement for a centralized data
      platform that enables advanced analytics and AI—alongside company-wide official reports—can be met by
      scalable platforms. These offer an end-to-end data and analytics toolchain, with costs starting as low as
      a few hundred euros per month and scaling with the company’s growth.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Optimized Stage – Integrated, Diverse Toolsets:</strong><br>
      At this stage, a diverse set of tools supports various business lines and processes. Capabilities such as
      modern AI chatbots and agents, real-time reporting and analytics, and in-process control and monitoring
      should be appropriately orchestrated and enabled by holistic data and analytics platforms such as
      Microsoft Fabric, Databricks, and OpenAI. This allows the company to reach—and maintain—an optimized
      analytical state.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Needless to say, fostering a <strong>data-driven culture</strong> and enabling people within the company to
    leverage and extract value from these analytical capabilities is a critical prerequisite for these initiatives
    to make sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    While I’ve worked with many large corporations, it was during my 5+ years leading the BI &amp; Analytics team
    at <strong>PeopleCert</strong> that I helped an SME reach a <em>Scaled (Level 3)</em> level of analytical
    maturity—even before GenAI and modern cloud platforms were available. Together with my team, we managed to:
  </p>


<ol>
<li>Increase Reporting Analysts' productivity 10-fold through Self-Service Analytics capabilities</li>

<li>Establish a Data-Driven culture, which impacted the quality of decisions as well as operations (e.g., the timeliness and completeness of invoiced exams)</li>

<li>Build the Enterprise Data Warehouse, which serves as the ‘single version of truth’ for decision-making</li>

<li>Develop Automatic Reports &amp; Advanced Analytics deliverables to:</li>

<ul>
<li>Support strategic decisions through value stream monitoring & process mining</li>
<li>Inform business stakeholders through tactical sales reports across regions & product lines</li>
<li>Provide automatic P&L, budget monitoring and other financial reporting capability</li>
<li>Promote quality of customer service & online proctoring through KPI's & six sigma metrics</li>
<li>Monitor procurement & examinations processes through tactical & operational BI</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<p>Today Peoplecert <b>is not an SME any more. It is a global player with over &euro;1bn valuation!</b>
